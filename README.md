# STTC-code
the code is for the paper Image Completion Using Low Tensor Tree Rank and Total Variation Minimization.

------------------------------------------------------
You can try just run the

demo_test.m for color image completion

------------------------------------------------------
For setting up, we can add path by the following sentence.

addpath('mylib');
addpath('htucker_1.2');
addpath('tensorlab');

------------------------------------------------------

 We also provide an introduction for quickly understanding our algorithm (Image Completion Using Low Tensor Tree Rank and Total Variation Minimization.pdf).
